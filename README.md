# Calgary Crime Data Analysis and Neural Network Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes Calgary's crime data and utilizes neural networks to predict future crime trends. It involves data preprocessing, visualization, and predictive modeling to assist law enforcement and policymakers in crime prevention.

## 🚀 Features

- Data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Crime trend visualization and pattern recognition
- Implementation of machine learning and neural network models
- Model evaluation and comparison
- Crime prediction for better decision-making

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset contains historical crime records, including:

- **Crime Type**
- **Location**
- **Date & Time**
- **Severity**
- **Reported Cases**

## 📊 Machine Learning Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- Neural Networks (Deep Learning)
- Time Series Forecasting Models

## 🔥 Results

The models are evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The neural network model provides predictive insights into crime patterns.
